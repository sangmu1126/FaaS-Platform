**User-Friendly FaaS Dashboard & BFF Layer**

## 📖 Introduction

This directory contains the **Web Frontend** for deploying functions, viewing logs, and monitoring system status, along with a supporting **Backend Proxy**. It is built with a modern React stack to provide an intuitive UI/UX.

---

## 📂 Directory Structure

```bash
application/
├── frontend/           # React + Vite + TailwindCSS (User Dashboard)
└── backend/            # Node.js + Express (BFF Proxy & Logging Gateway)
```

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

You need to install dependencies and run the server in each directory.

### 1. Frontend (React App)

The user dashboard for function management, execution, and log viewing.

#### Installation & Run
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

#### Configuration (.env)
Create a `.env` file in the `frontend` folder and set the API server address.
Note: `.env` is not committed to Git for security (`.env.example` provided).

```ini
# frontend/.env
VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://<YOUR_BFF_HOST>:8080/api
```

---

### 2. Backend (Optional Proxy)

A BFF (Backend For Frontend) mediating between the Frontend and Infra Controller.
It handles CORS, hides API keys, and aggregates logs.

#### Installation & Run
```bash
cd backend
npm install
npm run dev
```

#### Configuration (.env)
```ini
# backend/.env
PORT=3000
AWS_CONTROLLER_URL=http://<YOUR_CONTROLLER_IP>:8080
INFRA_API_KEY=<TERRAFORM_INFRA_API_KEY_OUTPUT>
AUTH_TOKEN_SECRET=<AT_LEAST_32_RANDOM_CHARACTERS>
```

The infrastructure API key is server-side only. Do not expose it through a
`VITE_*` variable; the BFF adds it when forwarding requests to the Controller.

## ⚠️ Configuration Guide

Configuration is managed via environment variables, not hardcoding.

- **Frontend**: Loads variables prefixed with `VITE_` in `src/config.ts`.
- **Backend**: Uses `dotenv` for configuration management.
- **Git**: All sensitive `.env` files are in `.gitignore`. Inject variables during deployment.
